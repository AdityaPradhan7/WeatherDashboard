## üìÑ Description  
Global Weather Dashboard is a browser-based, user-friendly platform that enables users to search for any city via text or voice and receive real-time weather information, air quality levels, local time, forecast, past weather data, and interactive map with temperature and AQI overlays. This app fetches accurate data from multiple external APIs and presents it in an organized and visually appealing interface.

## ‚ú® Key Features

1. **Search Functionality**
   - Text input-based city search
   - Voice search using the browser‚Äôs built-in **Web Speech API**
   - Auto-fills city name from a phrase like:  
     _"Tell me the weather in **New Delhi**"_ ‚Üí Extracts the city name **New Delhi** and searches for it
     _"Get weather for **Chandigarh**"_ ‚Üí Extracts the city name **Chandigarh** and searches for it
     üîç Real-Time Suggestions
   - Integrated the GeoDB Cities API for real-time autocomplete suggestions while typing. The suggestions dynamically update with each keystroke, helping users quickly find their desired city.

2. **Location & Time Info**
   - Converts city name to latitude and longitude using **OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API**
   - Displays local time using **TimeZoneDB API** (via Syncloop)

3. **Current Weather + Forecast**
   - Real-time weather data via **OpenWeatherMap Current Weather API** (via Syncloop)
   - 6-day weather forecast with temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and icons

4. **Air Quality**
   - Live air quality data using **OpenWeatherMap Air Pollution API** (via Syncloop)

5. **Past Weather Data**
   - Past weather data based on date range using **Open-Meteo Historical Weather API**
   - Max and min temperatures displayed daily

6. **Interactive Map**
   - Embedded **Leaflet.js map**
   - **OpenStreetMap** as base map
   - **OpenWeatherMap Temperature Overlay**
   - **AQICN Air Quality Overlay**

## üöß Approach

### 1. Planning and Design
- Decided core modules: Search, Weather Data, Air Quality, Historical Data, Map
- Focused on simplicity, accessibility, and responsiveness
- Used clean layout and dynamic visual elements like Granim.js and Leaflet

### 2. Frontend Development
- Built in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Integrated Granim.js for dynamic background transitions
- Implemented voice search via Web Speech API

### 3. API Integration
- Used OpenWeatherMap‚Äôs Geocoding API to convert city names into lat/lon
- Fetched time, weather, and air data from Syncloop-managed APIs
- Integrated Open-Meteo and AQICN overlays separately

### 4. Testing and Debugging
- Ensured compatibility on different screen sizes and browsers
- Validated voice input, API responses, and data visualizations
- Debugged UI edge cases and error handling

### 5. Deployment
- Deployed frontend on **Vercel** for fast and global delivery
- Secured API keys by using backend routing *(initially)* and later replaced with Syncloop
